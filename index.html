            <h2>My experiences</h2>
            <p><strong>
                I Have been lived in different countries. I worked in China and Singapore for years in business analysis. 
                I also worked as a Software Engineer in the US for years. With those experiences, I was certainly able 
                to demonstrate my professional working ethic and skills. I am eager to contribute my skills and passion 
                to a team that shares my enthusiasm for cutting-edge technology.
